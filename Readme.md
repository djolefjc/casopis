  <h2>Blog/News Website  Version 1.0</h2>
    
  <p>This website is made for knowledge purposes only. I do not own any pictures that were included. 
    There will be other types of websites. This is my attempt to learn WEB Dev/Des from various sources. </p>

  it and expand my web development skills. </p>
