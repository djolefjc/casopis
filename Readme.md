  <h2>Blog/News Website </h2>
    
  <p>This website is made for knowledge purposes only. I do not own any pictures that were included. 
    There will be other types of websites. This is my attempt to learn WEB Dev/Des from various sources. </p>
    
    <p> Website backend finished, this is version 1.0, without any awesome styling. </p>
 
<p> Website address:
https://casopis.000webhostapp.com/ </p>

<p> Control panel is accessed by pressing the lock button. Username and password are both admin. </p>
<p> Feel free to comment, and make posts. The idea is to confront issues of maintaining a website so that I can learn from
  it and expand my Web Development skills. </p>
